# Association Rule Based Recommender System
## Business Problem:
Armut, the largest online service platform in Turkey, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services. With just a few touches on your computer or smartphone, it provides easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, and transportation. An association rule learning-based product recommendation system is desired to be created using the dataset containing service-receiving users and the services and categories they have received.

## Dataset:
The dataset consists of the services purchased by customers and the categories of these services. It includes the date and time information for each service.

- UserId: Customer number
- ServiceId: Anonymized services for each category (e.g. couch cleaning service under the Cleaning category). A ServiceId can be found under different categories and represents different services under different categories.
- CategoryId: Anonymized categories (e.g. Cleaning, Moving, Renovation)
- CreateDate: Purchase date of the service.
